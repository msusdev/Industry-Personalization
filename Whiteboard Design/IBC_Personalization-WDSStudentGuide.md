## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the points you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions from the participants.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session  

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**Have fun!** Encourage participants to have fun and share!

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get participants to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

## Abstract and learning objectives

Parts Unlimited Retail, INC. has been feeling some pain and would like your help to redesign and implement some new solutions to be able to better compete in the current marketplace.  Among the main problems that Parts Unlimited is facing are 

*   Lack of connection between online and in-store data leading to an inability to provide a selection optimization that is tailored to a specific customer
*   Inconsistent pricing, promotion, product availability, and fulfilment strategies exist across their various channels
*   Customers are not completing orders due to redundant steps in the shopping journey, and encountering irrelevant interactions with the system
*   Currently, Parts Unlimited is unable to address latent customer needs
*   Parts Unlimited is unable to deliver an engaging and compelling experience to their customers regardless of platform or location.
*   Customer experiences vary when shopping across channels, including having fragmented and inconsistent experiences. 
*   Parts Unlimited currently is unable to maximize the effectiveness of their workforce.

To remedy this solution, Parts Unlimited is asking you to deliver a solution that will allow their customers to experience a smooth and relevant experience, regardless of the platform, device, and/or channel from which they are shopping. Of great importance is the ability to deliver dynamic and rich content that includes augmented and mixed-reality experiences.  Furthermore, customer data should be used to present relevant shopping experiences and product consistency to delight their customers. 

Parts Unlimited wants to ensure that they have maximized their ad spend for increased ROI and increased revenue.  Additionally, Parts Unlimited wants their customers to have an engaging experience that is similar on all digital channels and in their brick-and-mortar stores. 

An additional piece of information Parts Unlimited would like is the ability to be able to optimize the utilization and effectiveness of their workforce.  

In the end, your solution should provide a vision that allows the audience (the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager) to understand how using this solution will give the information that is needed to deliver a solid personalization experience for Parts Unlimited's users.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Parts Unlimited, a subsidiary of Fabrikam Retail INC., has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years.  As various platforms and technologies have evolved, Parts Unlimited has struggled to keep up, but has done the best they could to continue to provide solutions for their customers.  

Currently, they have just over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but are planning to close 50+ of these stores next year, taking the number of physical locations down to 150 stores due to declining revenue and various other factors.  Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago.  The re-branded stores were chosen based on population bases of less than 50,000 in an 200 square mile radius or within 50 miles of a major metropolitan area. These rebranded "Parts Unlimited Hometown" stores eliminated most of the non-essential retail, such as sporting and workout equipment, and focused in on essentials like appliances, automotive, and kept a limited selection of electronics, only offering about 15% of the options for items like UHD televisions, antennas, and blu-ray players.  Customers have expressed frustrations when an advertisement in the local newspaper for Parts Unlimited included a great deal on a large-screen television only to find they have to order online or drive to the larger store in a city that is sometimes located over 50 miles away.  While it is clear that customers are not pleased with this solution, it is not clear if this is an effective strategy to save the company when it comes to providing a simplified retail option. 

In addition to re-branding efforts, in the past few years attempts have been made to enhance the web app for responsive delivery and a couple of apps were also built to specifically target IOS and Android devices. Unfortunately, the data from these applications and the web solution is not connected, and when a user switches devices or goes from a device to the web, the experience is not uniform, leading to confusion and frustration.  Questions such as "why isn't the item I selected on my phone in my cart when I go to the website?" are far too common.    

Parts Unlimited needs an ability to collect and analyze all of this data in order to make the best uniform solution possible.   The solution needs to allow for a user to be able to walk into a brick-and-mortar store and get the items they are looking for, or to be able to switch from any device to the web or from the web to a device and get a streamlined experience.  Finally, the customer needs to leave the shopping experience as an advocate for the company, having been delivered an experience that they would recommend to others.   

#### Customer's current process

Parts Unlimited currently has over 200 brick-and-mortar stores, with 50+ stores closing and 35 stores running the re-branded profile.  Some stores have a pre-determined, limited selection and a limited inventory of the products they do offer. 

Parts Unlimited has an MVC website written in the .Net Framework and has been previously upgraded to version 4.72. The website is supposed to be responsive, as it utilized Bootstrap for responsive layout, but the site is currently not able to work on a few devices due to some styling problems.  

In addition to the website, Parts Unlimited has an Android application written in native Java that is three versions behind the current version of Android, but has been upgraded enough to continue to work on newer devices, even though it does not necessarily leverage all of the features of newer devices.  

Along with the website and android app, a third app written in Swift is available for use on the Apple IOS devices.  

All applications and sites do work, but the user experience, including sign-on, shopping cart, and other factors is unique to each platform.  For example, a user must sign in on the website and then sign in again on the device, and the shopping cart is not shared across devices, so items added to the cart on the web do not show up on the phone, or vice-versa.

As a struggling retailer, Parts Unlimited has a limited amount of resources to apply to getting the entire experience upgraded, so they need you to come up with the best, cost-effective solution.   

### Current Process  

![High level view of the current process](media/personalization/CurrentProcess.png 'Current process diagram') 

### Customer needs

1. Deliver a seamless experience to the user, regardless of platform, device, or location (online or at brick-and-mortar traditional stores).  Current system uses multiple accounts and systems.  Need to provide a complete 360 degree customer experience, making the customer experience relational, rather than transactional.

2. Use customer data to deliver a relevant shopping experience, including advertisements and product information based on the customer's search and shopping history. 

3. Provide a customer experience on any delivery that provides dynamic and rich content.  Content should leverage current trends and provide relevant cross-sell opportunities.  Think "customers who bought W also liked X, Y, and Z."  Also think "we know you, and we know you would like this too."  

4. Ability to use machine learning and AI to create actionable, monetizable insights into customer patterns and industry trends.

5. Get customer satisfaction metrics and use those to be able to guide improvements.  This could be in the form of surveys but would be nice if this included customer suggestions for improvement.  

6. Customer data needs to be protected, and any governance needs to be easy to implement and effectively managed. 

7. The solution needs to be robust and flexible to respond to market trends or other insights in the future.  

### Customer objections

1. Our customer experience is fine the way it is.  We currently have good reviews online.  Calls to the customer service line are answered quickly and effectively. Isn't there a better way to spend our limited resources of time and money?

2. Our customer loyalty is very high - it's why we are able to stay in business this long.  Will this hurt our customer loyalty or our brand image? 

3. How do we ensure that the customer data we are tracking and keeping is not violating any privacy laws?  Our concern here is that if we are breached, we could be facing a very serious lawsuit.  

4. How will using this solution provide the ability to offer products a customer might like?  I am certain that our retail workers know their customers better than any algorithm ever could.

5. It is hard to believe that the insights generated by this solution will be able to provide better marketing campaign ideas and targets than our seasoned marketing team that knows who our customers are and what they like.

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1. Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

_High-level architecture_

1. Will data transformation be needed?

2. If so, Which option would you recommend and why?

_Data processing_

1. How will you filter the data to get relevant information?

2. How will you ensure that data processes are repeatable?

_Dashboards and reporting_

1. Parts Unlimited's business analysts would like to have a set of dashboards they can monitor that provide real-time views of customer data. What do you propose using to meet this requirement? Be specific about how this solution will be put in place and which features it supports, and why it will be useful to the business analysts.

2. Parts Unlimited's marketing team would like to be able to get insights from the data, and be able to identify trends, as well as see how effective various marketing strategies are.   How will you provide this data to them to enable them to ensure an optimal customer experience?

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.
