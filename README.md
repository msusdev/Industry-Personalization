## Abstract and learning objectives

Parts Unlimited Retail, INC. has been feeling some pain and would like your help to redesign and implement some new solutions to be able to better compete in the current marketplace.  Among the main problems that Parts Unlimited is facing are 

*   Lack of connection between online and in-store data leading to an inability to provide a selection optimization that is tailored to a specific customer
*   Inconsistent pricing, promotion, product availability, and fulfilment strategies exist across their various channels
*   Customers are not completing orders due to redundant steps in the shopping journey, and encountering irrelevant interactions with the system
*   Currently, Parts Unlimited is unable to address latent customer needs
*   Parts Unlimited is unable to deliver an engaging and compelling experience to their customers regardless of platform or location.
*   Customer experiences vary when shopping across channels, including having fragmented and inconsistent experiences. 
*   Parts Unlimited currently is unable to maximize the effectiveness of their workforce.

To remedy this solution, Parts Unlimited is asking you to deliver a solution that will allow their customers to experience a smooth and relevant experience, regardless of the platform, device, and/or channel from which they are shopping. Of great importance is the ability to deliver dynamic and rich content that includes augmented and mixed-reality experiences.  Furthermore, customer data should be used to present relevant shopping experiences and product consistency to delight their customers. 

Parts Unlimited wants to ensure that they have maximized their ad spend for increased ROI and increased revenue.  Additionally, Parts Unlimited wants their customers to have an engaging experience that is similar on all digital channels and in their brick-and-mortar stores. 

An additional piece of information Parts Unlimited would like is the ability to be able to optimize the utilization and effectiveness of their workforce.  

In the end, your solution should provide a vision that allows the audience (the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager) to understand how using this solution will give the information that is needed to deliver a solid personalization experience for Parts Unlimited's users.
